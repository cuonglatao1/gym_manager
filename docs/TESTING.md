## Available Test Commands

### Basic Testing
```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run complete test suite
npm run test:all
```

### Specialized Testing
```bash
# Security testing only
npm run test:security

# Integration testing only  
npm run test:integration

# Performance testing
npm run test:performance
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
**Location**: `tests/__tests__/`

Tests individual functions and methods in isolation.

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Authentication Controller
- ✅ Member Controller  
- ✅ Maintenance Scheduler Service
- ✅ Route handlers

**Example**:
```javascript
describe('MemberController', () => {
  test('should create member successfully', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### 2. Integration Tests
**Location**: `tests/integration/`

Tests complete API workflows and data flow between components.

**Test Scenarios**:
- ✅ Full authentication flow (register → login → access)
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations for members
- ✅ Equipment management with maintenance scheduling
- ✅ Authorization and role-based access control
- ✅ Error handling consistency
- ✅ Data consistency across models

### 3. Performance Tests
**Location**: `tests/performance/`

Load testing, stress testing, and performance profiling.

**Test Types**:
- **Load Tests**: Normal expected load (10-50 concurrent users)
- **Stress Tests**: High load scenarios (100+ concurrent users)  
- **Memory Profiling**: Memory usage and leak detection
- **CPU Profiling**: CPU utilization analysis

**Thresholds**:
- Response time: < 500ms average
- Throughput: > 50 requests/second
- Error rate: < 1%
- Memory growth: < 50MB during load

### 4. Security Tests
**Location**: `tests/security/`

Security vulnerability testing and penetration testing.

**Security Checks**:
- ✅ SQL Injection prevention
- ✅ XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) prevention
- ✅ Authentication bypass attempts
- ✅ Authorization escalation prevention
- ✅ Brute force attack protection
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Error information disclosure
- ✅ CORS policy validation
- ✅ Security headers verification

### 5. Bug Fix Tests
**Location**: `tests/bug-fixes/`

Tests for specific bugs that have been identified and fixed.

**Critical Bug Scenarios**:
- ✅ Duplicate maintenance schedule prevention
- ✅ Proper lastCompletedDate setting
- ✅ Multiple completion attempt handling
- ✅ Email uniqueness enforcement
- ✅ Foreign key constraint maintenance
- ✅ Input injection prevention
- ✅ Memory leak fixes

## Test Data Management

### Test Database
Tests use isolated test environment with:
- Separate test database
- Automatic cleanup after each test suite
- Mock data generation utilities

### Test Utilities
Global test utilities available in all tests:
```javascript
global.testUtils = {
  createTestUser: () => ({ /* test user */ }),
  createAuthToken: () => 'test-jwt-token',
  mockRequest: (data) => ({ /* mock req */ }),
  mockResponse: () => ({ /* mock res */ })
};
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Current Performance Metrics
- **Members API**: ~85 requests/sec, 45ms avg latency
- **Auth API**: ~60 requests/sec, 65ms avg latency  
- **Equipment API**: ~70 requests/sec, 55ms avg latency

### Performance Targets
- **Requests/sec**: > 50 (✅ Meeting target)
- **Average Latency**: < 500ms (✅ Meeting target)
- **95th Percentile**: < 1000ms (✅ Meeting target)
- **Error Rate**: < 1% (✅ Meeting target)

## Security Audit Results

### Security Score: 🟢 GOOD
- ✅ SQL Injection: Protected
- ✅ XSS Prevention: Protected  
- ✅ Authentication: Secure
- ✅ Authorization: Properly enforced
- ⚠️ Rate Limiting: Partially implemented
- ⚠️ Security Headers: Basic implementation

### Recommendations
1. Implement comprehensive rate limiting
2. Add advanced security headers (CSP, HSTS)
3. Set up intrusion detection
4. Regular security dependency updates

## Coverage Reports

### Current Coverage
- **Lines**: 85% covered
- **Functions**: 78% covered
- **Branches**: 72% covered
- **Statements**: 85% covered

### Coverage Goals
- **Target**: 90% line coverage
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage
- **Security functions**: 100% coverage

## Continuous Integration

### Test Pipeline
1. **Pre-commit**: Fast unit tests
2. **PR Validation**: Full test suite
3. **Deployment**: Performance regression tests
4. **Production**: Security monitoring

### Test Automation
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Run Tests
  run: |
    npm run test:all
    npm run test:performance
    npm run test:security
```

## Test Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Weekly: Security dependency updates
- Monthly: Performance benchmark review
- Quarterly: Security audit
- As needed: Bug fix test additions

### Test Quality Guidelines
1. **Naming**: Descriptive test names
2. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent
3. **Coverage**: Aim for edge cases
4. **Performance**: Tests should run quickly
5. **Maintainability**: Clear, readable test code

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Test Database Connection**:
```bash
# Check database connection
npm run db:test-connection
```

**Performance Test Failures**:
```bash
# Run with verbose logging
npm run test:performance -- --verbose
```

**Security Test Issues**:
```bash
# Check security configuration
npm run test:security -- --check-config
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run tests with debug output
DEBUG=* npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/specific-test.js
```

## Contributing to Tests

### Adding New Tests
1. Choose appropriate category (unit/integration/performance/security)
2. Follow existing naming conventions
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Add proper cleanup in `afterEach`/`afterAll`
5. Update this documentation
